# About ANTA
The Arctic Nearshore Turbidity Algorithm (ANTA) is an ocean color remote sensing algorithm that relates water-leaving reflectance to surface water turbidity. It is based on the semi-empirical relationships presented in Nechad et al. 2009 (DOI: 10.1117/12.830700) and Dogliotti et al. 2015 (DOI: 10.1016/j.rse.2014.09.020). It was designed to be used with multiple active and historical satellite sensors: Landsat 8 (OLI), Sentinel 2 (MSI), Sentinel 3 (OLCI), MODIS (Aqua), Landsat 4/5 (TM), Landsat 7 (ETM+).

# Usage
The ANTA usus water-leaving reflectance in the red and NIR bands to relate surface water turbidity. It is recommended to use the ACOLITE (https://github.com/acolite/acolite) atmospheric correction (AC), as its results best results in nearshore waters. The ANTA works with each AC towards water-leaving reflectance, though. An example to use the ACOLITE AC is included in code, but the ACOLITE manual is recommended before usage.

# Depenencies
The ANTA is coded in Python 3 and is provided as Jupyter Notebook. It requires the following Python packages to run: numpy, matplotlib, netCDF4, and cartopy. In case you want to work with GeoTIFF instead of NetCDF, the use of rasterio is recommended (not provided in the script).
